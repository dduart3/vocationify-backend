# Vocationify Backend Flow Explanation

Let me explain the complete flow of how the RIASEC vocational test backend works:

## **1. Overall Architecture Flow**

```
Frontend Request → Express App → Middleware → Routes → Controllers → Services → Models → Database
                                     ↓
Frontend Response ← JSON Response ← Business Logic ← Data Processing ← SQL Queries ← Supabase
```

## **2. Test Session Lifecycle**

### **Phase 1: Session Creation**
```
POST /api/sessions
```

**Flow:**
1. **Request arrives** at Express app
2. **Middleware chain:**
   - Rate limiting (max 10 requests/minute)
   - Zod validation (optional user_id)
   - CORS headers
3. **SessionController.createSession():**
   - Calls `SessionService.createSession()`
   - Creates new session in database
   - Initializes RIASEC scores (all zeros)
   - Gets first question from question bank
4. **Response:** Session ID + first question

### **Phase 2: Question-Answer Loop**
```
POST /api/questions/response
GET /api/questions/:sessionId/next
```

**Answer Submission Flow:**
1. **User submits answer** (1-5 scale)
2. **Validation:** Zod validates all fields
3. **QuestionController.submitResponse():**
   - Validates question exists
   - Calls `SessionService.saveResponse()`
   - **Updates RIASEC scores** using weighted algorithm
   - Gets session context to check progress
   - Determines next question or completion
4. **Response:** Next question OR completion signal

**Next Question Selection Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Priority system for question selection:
1. Underexplored RIASEC types (< 2 questions)
2. Weakest types (to confirm they're actually weak)  
3. Strongest types (to confirm they're actually strong)
4. Random from remaining questions
```

## **3. RIASEC Scoring Algorithm**

### **How Scores Are Calculated:**
```typescript
// Each question has weights like:
riasec_weights: { R: 3, I: 1, A: 0, S: 0, E: 0, C: 0 }

// User response (1-5) gets normalized to (0-1):
normalizedResponse = (response_value - 1) / 4

// Score update for each dimension:
newScore = currentScore + (normalizedResponse × weight)
```

**Example:**
- Question: "I enjoy working with tools and machinery"
- Weights: `{ R: 3, I: 1, A: 0, S: 0, E: 0, C: 0 }`
- User answers: 4 (Agree)
- Normalized: (4-1)/4 = 0.75
- Realistic score += 0.75 × 3 = +2.25
- Investigative score += 0.75 × 1 = +0.75

## **4. Adaptive Question Selection**

### **Smart Question Selection:**
```typescript
// The system analyzes:
1. Question distribution per RIASEC type
2. Current score patterns
3. Underexplored areas
4. Test completion criteria

// Ensures balanced exploration of all 6 RIASEC dimensions
```

### **Completion Criteria:**
- **Minimum:** 12 questions answered
- **Distribution:** At least 1 question per RIASEC type
- **Maximum:** 20 questions (auto-complete)
- **Optimal:** 15-18 questions with good distribution

## **5. Data Flow Through Layers**

### **Request Processing:**
```
1. Express App receives HTTP request
2. Middleware Stack:
   - Helmet (security headers)
   - CORS (cross-origin handling)
   - Rate limiting
   - Body parsing
   - Zod validation
   - Authentication (optional)

3. Router matches endpoint
4. Controller handles business logic
5. Service layer processes data
6. Model layer handles database operations
7. Response sent back through same chain
```

### **Database Operations:**
```sql
-- Session creation
INSERT INTO test_sessions (id, user_id, status)
INSERT INTO riasec_scores (session_id, realistic_score, ...)

-- Response saving
INSERT INTO test_responses (session_id, question_id, response_value, ...)
UPDATE riasec_scores SET realistic_score = realistic_score + ?

-- Results retrieval
SELECT * FROM riasec_scores WHERE session_id = ?
SELECT * FROM test_responses WHERE session_id = ?
```

## **6. Key Service Interactions**

### **SessionService:**
- Manages test sessions lifecycle
- Updates RIASEC scores in real-time
- Analyzes test state and completion criteria
- Provides session context for decision making

### **QuestionService:**
- Intelligent question selection
- Avoids duplicate questions
- Balances RIASEC type exploration
- Integrates with AI service for dynamic questions

### **RiasecService:**
- Score normalization and analysis
- Personality type determination
- Career suggestions generation
- Statistical analysis of results

## **7. Real-Time Decision Making**

### **After Each Response:**
```typescript
// System evaluates:
1. Current RIASEC score distribution
2. Question coverage per type
3. Test completion readiness
4. Optimal next question type

// Decisions made:
- Continue with specific RIASEC type?
- Explore underrepresented area?
- Ready for completion?
- Generate AI question if needed?
```

## **8. Results Generation Flow**

### **Basic Results:**
```
GET /api/results/:sessionId
```
1. Retrieve all responses and scores
2. Normalize scores to percentages
3. Generate RIASEC code (top 3 types)
4. Create personality description
5. Suggest relevant careers

### **Detailed Analysis:**
```
GET /api/results/:sessionId/detailed
```
1. Response pattern analysis
2. Consistency scoring
3. Response time analysis
4. Recommendations for further exploration

## **9. Error Handling & Recovery**

### **Graceful Degradation:**
- If AI service fails → Use static question bank
- If database is slow → Implement timeouts
- If validation fails → Clear error messages
- If session expires → Allow recovery

### **Data Integrity:**
- Atomic database operations
- Rollback on failures
- Duplicate prevention
- Session state validation

## **10. Performance Optimizations**

### **Caching Strategy:**
- Question bank loaded in memory
- Session context cached during active use
- Database connection pooling
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

### **Scalability Features:**
- Stateless design (scales horizontally)
- Database-driven state management
- Async/await throughout
- Efficient SQL queries with indexes

This architecture ensures a smooth, intelligent, and scalable vocational testing experience that adapts to each user's responses while maintaining scientific rigor in the RIASEC assessment methodology.
